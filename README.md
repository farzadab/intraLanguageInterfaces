# Intra-Language Interfaces

Interfaces for using code from one language in another.

Currently I only have the interface from Python to C++ and vice versa.
There are instructions in addition to a working example that you I hope you can just run out of the box, but there might be differences in different operating systems (I'm using a Ubuntu based Linux).

### List of interfaces:
  - [C++ to Python](./c2py)
  - [Python to C++](./py2c)
